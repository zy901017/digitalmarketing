## Project Snapshot

A home cleaning service covering Adelaide's eastern suburbs wanted to expand their service area and attract more regular clients. They had tried Facebook Ads before but struggled with high costs and low-quality leads.

## The Challenge

- Previous Facebook campaigns generated leads but most didn't convert to bookings
- Cost per lead was $35-40, making it hard to be profitable
- No system for tracking which leads became customers
- Generic ad creative that didn't stand out in the feed

## Our Strategy

**1. Audience Targeting Refinement**
- Created lookalike audiences based on existing customers
- Targeted homeowners in specific high-value suburbs
- Excluded low-intent audiences

**2. Creative Strategy**
- Before/after photos of cleaning results
- Video testimonials from happy customers
- Special offers for first-time bookings

**3. Lead Qualification**
- Added pre-qualifying questions to lead forms
- Implemented instant email responses with booking information
- Set up automated follow-up sequence

## Results

- Cost per lead dropped to $12.50 (-64%)
- 84% increase in monthly bookings
- Expanded successfully to 3 new suburbs
- 5.8:1 return on ad spend
