## Project Snapshot

A local Adelaide landscaping business relied heavily on referrals. Their website ranked for brand terms but failed to generate consistent quote requests from organic search.

## The Challenge

- Service pages were thin and not structured for local intent
- Google Business Profile was incomplete and inconsistent
- No reliable tracking for phone clicks and form submissions
- Mobile UX was slow, leading to drop-offs

## Our Strategy

**1. Local SEO foundation**
- Cleaned up on-page titles and local service targeting
- Fixed NAP consistency and improved Google Business Profile signals
- Built a simple internal linking structure across services and suburbs

**2. Landing page conversion**
- Rewrote service pages with clear offers and proof (reviews, examples, guarantees)
- Added “Request a Quote” CTA above the fold
- Simplified the form and improved page speed

**3. Measurement**
- Implemented GA4 events for calls, forms, and key engagement actions

## Results (8 weeks)

- +52% increase in quote requests (organic + direct combined)
- +38% more organic calls from mobile
- +29% conversion rate improvement on service pages
